# Hybrid SWAT-SVR Streamflow Prediction Model

This repository provides an implementation of a hybrid hydrological modeling approach that integrates the **Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)** with **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** to improve monthly streamflow prediction accuracy at multiple gauge stations.

The work is based on the methods and findings published in:

- **PLOS ONE (2021)**: [A hybrid SWAT-SVR model for improving streamflow prediction](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0248489)
- **Water (2022)**: [Development of a wavelet-enhanced SWAT-WSVR model for monthly flow simulation](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/14/17/2649)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The project enhances SWAT-simulated streamflow by post-processing its outputs using machine learning:
- **SVR** models correct systematic biases and improve accuracy
- Seasonal separation (wet/dry) is used to address hydroclimatic heterogeneity
- Model performance is evaluated using **NSE**, **RÂ²**, **PBIAS**, **RMSE**, and **RSR**
